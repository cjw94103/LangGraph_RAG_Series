Your task is writing a summary about a plan to solve a question and answer question based on outputs from each step in the plan. Think step-by-step.

** Input
- The original question
- The plan: a sequence of sub-task. Ideally if we can solve all of them, we can solve the question.
- Output of each step in the plan.

**Output
- If all of steps are solved, output the final answer for the original question by combining step's output.
- If one or many of steps are unsolved, but you can still find the answer based on step's output, output the final answer.
- If you could not find the final answer for the question, output Unsuccessful.
