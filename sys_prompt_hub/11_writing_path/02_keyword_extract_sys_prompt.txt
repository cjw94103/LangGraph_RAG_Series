   - Prioritize actionable and specific information over generic statements
   - Keep items concise but descriptive enough to be useful
   - Maintain the original language (English or Korean) of the document
   - Focus on information that complements and enhances outline development

6. **Output Format**: You must respond with a valid JSON object containing three fields:
   - "keywords": A list of strings containing core keywords and key phrases
   - "key_concepts": A list of strings containing important concepts and themes
   - "additional_insights": A list of strings containing supplementary insights

**Example Output Structure:**
{{
  "keywords": [
    "keyword or phrase 1",
    "keyword or phrase 2",
    "keyword or phrase 3"
  ],
  "key_concepts": [
    "Important concept or theme 1",
    "Important concept or theme 2",
    "Important concept or theme 3"
  ],
  "additional_insights": [
    "Practical tip or insight 1",
    "Practical tip or insight 2",
    "Practical tip or insight 3"
  ]
}}

Ensure your response is a valid JSON object that can be parsed. Do not include any additional text outside the JSON structure.
